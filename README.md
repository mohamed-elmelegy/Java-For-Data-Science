# Java-For-Data-Science
> This contains my solutions for the practical assignments in "Java For Data Science" course in [ITI-AI 9 Months Professional Training Program](https://ai.iti.gov.eg/epita/ai-engineer/ "Program's Website") Powered By [EPITA](https://www.epita.fr/en/ "EPITA's Website")
-----------

## Course Objective:
Main objective of this course is to focus on using Java programming language **to emphasize understanding of the principles of object oriented programming**, and **to get quick insights about different prcesses in Data Science projects workflow**. The course inclouded:
- Learning Alot About Different Java Built-In Data Structure
- Functional Programming And Stream APIs
- Different File Format Handling And Data Extraction
- Dataset Preraration And Exploration
- Simple Data Visualization
- Introduction To Data Distributed Processing And Big Data World
- Simple Machine Learning Modeling
- Deployment Of Machine Learning Model On A Web Service
-----------

## Tasks Included:
1) Simple task to read data from console into text file. [Link](https://github.com/mohamed-elmelegy/Java-For-Data-Science/ "ConsoleIntoFile")
1) Simple task to use **BiPredicate Lambda functions** on Strings. [Link](https://github.com/mohamed-elmelegy/Java-For-Data-Science/ "LambdaBetterString")
1) Hands on data extraction from CSV file contains data about [Egyptian Pyramids](https://www.kaggle.com/lsind18/egyptianpyramids), then apply some tasks on Pyramid Objects List like: Sort, Grouping, etc... using **Java Stream** only. [Link](https://github.com/mohamed-elmelegy/Java-For-Data-Science/ "Pyramids")
1) Hands on data extraction from 2 CSV files contains data about counries and their cities using **DAO _(Data Access Object)_ Design Pattern**, then exploring this data and get insights using some **Java Stream APIs** and **Lambda functions**. [Link](https://github.com/mohamed-elmelegy/Java-For-Data-Science/ "LambdaExpressionAndStreamApi")
1) Data extraction from JSON file contains data about **Titanic Survivors** using Java Liberary **Jackson**, then visualizing Passenger objects to get more insights with some charts like: **Histogram**, **PieChart** using Java Liberary **XChart**.
